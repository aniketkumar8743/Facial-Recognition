**Overview**
Facial recognition has become increasingly important in various applications such as security, user authentication, and social media tagging. This project employs a Siamese neural network, which is particularly effective for tasks involving similarity and verification. By training the model on a dataset of facial images, the system learns to distinguish between different individuals based on facial features.

**Features**
Siamese Network Architecture: Implements a dual-input structure that processes two images simultaneously to compute a similarity score.
Deep Learning Framework: Utilizes TensorFlow/Keras for building and training the neural network.
Custom Dataset: Trains the model on a curated dataset of facial images, allowing for effective learning of facial representations.
Face Detection and Verification: The model is capable of both detecting faces and verifying identities through similarity measures.
Getting Started

**Prerequisites**

Python 3.x
TensorFlow/Keras
Other necessary libraries (NumPy, OpenCV, etc.)

IN this model there is alot thing we can do like the first one is increase the size of data in positive and anchor file right now we only took somewhere around 500 data but if we increase that size somewhere around 4000 to 5000 it performation going to increase without any dot. the second things would be the epcohs once we increase the epcohs we can get better result than before.
